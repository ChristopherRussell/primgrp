# GAP Primitive Groups Library

The PrimGrp package provides the library of primitive permutation 
groups which includes, up to permutation isomorphism (i.e., up to
conjugacy in the corresponding symmetric group), all primitive 
permutation groups of degree < 4096.

It has been formerly a part of the core GAP system, and has been
converted to a separate GAP package in 2017 for the GAP 4.9 release.
